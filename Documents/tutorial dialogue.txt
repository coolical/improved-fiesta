hey some cowhands have appeared
cowhands are dangerous, they will shoot your aliens
hover your mouse over a cowhand to see where they can shoot at
when you press next turn cowhands will change the direction they are facing
a cowhand will only shoot one alien that is in its range each turn
cowhands can shoot over ravines and through trees
go kill those cowhands

good job

hey look those flags appeared
we cant have flags on our land
when you are hunting and ranching you want to get rid of all the texas flags, you dont have to kill all the humans


At start of actual game, show a text box that says:
remove after the first turn is finished
"
If you don't know how to play try the tutorial from the main menu.
Goal: Destroy all the Texas flags on the hivemind ranch!

Use the W,A,S, and D keys to move the viewport around the map,
or move the mouse near the edge of the map to move it in that direction

Press the 'Next Turn' button (or spacebar) to start the next turn.
